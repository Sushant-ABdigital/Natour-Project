# Natour-Project
This is the project I coded while learning advanced CSS technique with Jonas via Udemy platform.
This project was coded without the use of flexbox and CSS grid. I used only the old CSS techniques of floats and clearfix.
## Additional learning:
1. Usage of media queries in different situation
2. Image management / optimization based on either screen size, screen resolution or screenwidth.
3. Animation and checkbox technique for menu
4. Many more...
